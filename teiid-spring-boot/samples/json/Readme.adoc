This example show usage of @JsonTable annotation using which an JSON content can be read as Entity using Teiid. See `rest-example` project for a description of the example.

The difference of this example is

1) Instead of reading the JSON document from the a REST web service this example shows from reading from the JSON file.

2) This example also shows how to read the array type variable from a table type. This is example of reading a primitive array type.

3) This example also shows how to read array as object, or reading a JSON array that is not primitive type using the OneToMany type.
